# Project 1: Webscraping and the Journey for the Most Succesful Movies

#### Project Members:  Florencia Leoni and Fhel Dimano

The objective of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis on the film industry, define measures of success for a production company, and finish with **meaningful insights** that can help the CEO of the production company make the right business decisions to achieve success.

In order to accomplish this goal we gathered data by webscrabing and making API requests from the following websites:

            1. IMDB.com *Webscraping*
            2. TMDB.com *API requests*

The functions and scripts that were used in this project are in *Python and SQLite3*; you can find a clean commented version on the **Final_Code_Notebook**. If you'd like to see how we arrived at this point, please take a look at the files in the **Archive** folder.

The information pulled from webscraping and API requests was saved in csv files for conveniency. Those files can be found in the **Data** folder.

The database that was created to answer the SQLite queries can be foiund in the **movies.db** file.

Throughout the analysis we focused on 5 main questions:

        1. Is there a relationship between average revenue and the days on 
            the week/months when a movie is released?
        2. Does higher budget mean higher returns?
        3. Do popularity and vote count affect movie revenue?
        4. What should the genre of the next movie be?
        5. What has Lionsgate (fictional client) been up to in the past few years?

The answer to these questions can be found in **The_Movie_Project** file, along with some additional insights, and visualizations.
