Flatiron School - Data Science
MOD1 Project

Using data scraping and web APIs, we wrangled and clean data to provide insights on what makes a successful movie and share our interesting finds.

We set out to answer these questions:
1. Is there a relationship between average revenue and the days on the week/months when a movie is released?
2. Does higher budget mean higher returns?
3. Do popularity and vote count affect movie revenue?
4. What should the genre of the next movie be?
5. What has Lionsgate (fictional client) been up to in the past few years?
